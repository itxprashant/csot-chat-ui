   - Signing Mode: `Unsigned` (for frontend uploads)
   - Folder: `chat-files` (optional, for organization)
   - Resource type: `Auto`
   - Access mode: `Public`
5. Save the preset

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret-here
REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=chat_files
```

## Step 4: Supported File Types

## Troubleshooting

### Upload Failures
1. Check your Cloudinary credentials in `.env`
2. Verify your upload preset is set to "Unsigned"
3. Ensure the file size is under 10MB
4. Check browser console for error messages

### File Not Displaying
1. Check if the file URL is accessible
2. Verify the file type is supported
3. Check network connectivity

### Permission Issues
1. Ensure your Cloudinary account has sufficient quota
2. Check upload preset permissions
3. Verify API key permissions

## Security Considerations

- Upload preset is set to unsigned for simplicity
- Consider implementing signed uploads for production
- Monitor your Cloudinary usage and quotas
- Consider implementing file type restrictions server-side

## Cost Optimization

- Free tier includes 25GB storage and 25GB bandwidth
- Cloudinary automatically optimizes files
- Consider implementing automatic file cleanup for old messages
- Monitor usage in Cloudinary dashboard

## Production Deployment

For production environments:

1. Use signed upload presets
2. Implement server-side validation
3. Set up webhook notifications
4. Monitor usage and costs
5. Consider implementing file retention policies
