# JaaS Integration Summary

## What Was Implemented

Your chat application now supports **Jitsi as a Service (JaaS)** for professional-grade video conferencing! Here's what's been added:

## ✅ New Features

### 1. **JaaS Integration**
- Professional video conferencing with enhanced features
- JWT-based authentication for secure access
- Custom branding and enhanced UI
- Recording capabilities (available with JaaS)
- Better reliability and uptime

### 2. **Smart Fallback System**
- Automatically detects if JaaS is configured
- Falls back to free Jitsi Meet if JaaS is not available
- No disruption to existing functionality

### 3. **Enhanced UI**
- Shows "JaaS Powered" badge when using JaaS
- Shows "Free Jitsi" badge when using fallback
- Loading states and error handling
- Professional appearance

## ✅ Security Best Practices Implemented

### 🔐 **Proper Private Key Storage**
- ✅ Private keys stored in separate `.pem` files
- ✅ Keys kept in backend directory only (not frontend)
- ✅ Files added to `.gitignore` for security
- ✅ No sensitive data in environment variables

### 🏗️ **Architecture**
- ✅ **Frontend**: Only requests tokens from backend API
- ✅ **Backend**: Generates JWT tokens securely using private keys
- ✅ **Separation**: Complete separation of concerns for security
